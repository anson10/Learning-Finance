### **Steps to Project Champagne Sales Forecasting**

---

#### **1. Problem Understanding**
- Define the project objective: Forecast future champagne sales using historical data.
- Understand the dataset:
  - Time period: Monthly sales from 2000 to 2010.
  - Units: Sales measured in dozens.

---

#### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **Load the Dataset**:
  - Use `pandas` to import the dataset.
- **Inspect the Data**:
  - Check for missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
- **Handle Missing Data**:
  - Fill or interpolate missing values if needed.
- **Convert to Time Series**:
  - Ensure the "date" column is in `datetime` format and set as the index.
- **Stationarity Check**:
  - Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check if the data is stationary.
  - Apply transformations (log, difference) if necessary.

---

#### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Plot the time series data to observe trends and seasonality.
- Analyze autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation using ACF and PACF plots.
- Identify seasonal patterns, spikes, and anomalies.

---

#### **4. Model Selection**
- **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)**:
  - Suitable for univariate data.
  - Select parameters (p, d, q) using ACF/PACF and grid search.
- **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Factors)**:
  - Use if seasonality or external variables (e.g., promotions) are involved.
  - Select seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, S).

---

#### **5. Model Implementation**
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Fit ARIMA/SARIMAX models to the training data.
- Evaluate performance using test data.

---

#### **6. Model Evaluation**
- Compare predicted vs. actual values using:
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualize the forecast against historical data.

---

#### **7. Forecast Future Sales**
- Use the trained model to predict future monthly champagne sales.
- Plot the forecasted values with confidence intervals.

---

#### **8. Insights and Recommendations**
- Highlight observed trends and seasonal factors.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on forecasted sales patterns.

---

#### **9. Reporting**
- Document findings, visualizations, and conclusions.
- Prepare a summary report for stakeholders or presentation.
